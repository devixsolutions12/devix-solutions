# Devix Solutions - Deployment Success

## Issue Summary
The deployment was failing due to several issues:
1. Nested directory structure causing confusion in the project hierarchy
2. Remaining admin panel and authentication directories that were no longer needed
3. Cached build files that needed to be cleared

## Fixes Applied
1. Removed the nested `devix-solutions/devix-solutions` directory
2. Removed unused admin panel directories (`src/app/admin`)
3. Removed unused authentication API routes (`src/app/api/auth`)
4. Cleared the build cache (`.next` directory)
5. Performed a clean build
6. Successfully deployed to Vercel

## Final Deployment URL
https://devix-solutions-hm6n8vemw-om-anands-projects-f7ff15cb.vercel.app

## Contact Form Functionality
The contact form now correctly redirects users to Instagram DMs with their message, name, and email included in the message.

## Verification
- Local testing confirmed the API route works correctly
- Instagram redirection is properly formatted
- All unnecessary files and directories have been removed
- Clean build completed successfully
- Deployment to Vercel was successful

The website is now live and fully functional!
