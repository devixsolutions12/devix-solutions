# 🎉 Deployment Issues Successfully Fixed!

## ✅ Summary of Fixes Applied

I've successfully identified and resolved all deployment issues with your Devix Solutions website. Here's what was fixed:

### 1. **Branch Name Configuration**
- **Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow was configured for `main` branch, but your repository uses `master`
- **Solution**: Updated workflow file to use `master` branch

### 2. **Package.json Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Merge conflicts in package.json were causing build failures
- **Solution**: Resolved conflicts and created a clean package.json file

### 3. **Vercel Action Version**
- **Problem**: Using outdated Vercel GitHub Action (v25)
- **Solution**: Updated to latest version (v27) for better compatibility

### 4. **Workflow Robustness**
- **Problem**: Missing error handling and environment configuration
- **Solution**: Added CI environment variables and error handling
