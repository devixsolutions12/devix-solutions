### Option 1: Make Project Public Through Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select the "devix-solutions-new" project
3. Go to **Settings** > **General**
4. Scroll down to **Privacy** section
5. Change **Project Privacy** from "Private" to "Public"
6. Save changes

### Option 2: Create a New Public Project
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click **New Project**
3. Select your repository
4. During setup, ensure **Project Privacy** is set to "Public"
5. Deploy the project

## Verification
After making the project public:
1. The 401 Unauthorized error will disappear
2. Your website will be accessible at: https://devix-solutions-new.vercel.app
3. All functionality will work as expected:
   - Contact form redirects to Instagram
   - All pages load correctly
   - API endpoints function properly

## Summary
‚úÖ **Code is fully functional**
‚úÖ **Deployments complete successfully**
‚úÖ **Only Vercel project privacy setting needs to be changed**
‚ùå **No further code changes needed**

The website is ready to go live once you make the project public in the Vercel dashboard.
