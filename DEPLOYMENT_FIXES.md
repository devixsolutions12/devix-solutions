# 🛠️ Deployment Issues Fixed

## ✅ Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. **Branch Name Mismatch**
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions workflow was configured for `main` branch, but repository uses `master` branch
- **Fix**: Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use `master` branch instead of `main`

### 2. **Package.json Merge Conflict**
- **Issue**: Merge conflict in `package.json` file causing build failures
- **Fix**: Resolved conflict by creating a clean `package.json` with proper dependencies

### 3. **Outdated Vercel Action**
- **Issue**: Using older version of Vercel GitHub Action
- **Fix**: Updated from `amondnet/vercel-action@v25` to `amondnet/vercel-action@v27`

### 4. **Workflow Robustness**
- **Issue**: Missing error handling and environment variables
- **Fix**: Added `CI: true` environment variable and `continue-on-error: false` for better error reporting

## 📋 Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
   - Changed branch from `main` to `master`
   - Updated Vercel action version from v25 to v27
   - Added environment variables for better CI/CD experience

2. **`package.json`**
   - Resolved merge conflicts
   - Ensured all dependencies are properly listed
   - Maintained all existing scripts

## 🚀 Deployment Verification

The fixes have been pushed to GitHub and a new deployment has been triggered. You can monitor the deployment progress at:

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Checklist

If deployment still fails, check:

1. **Vercel Secrets**:
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Your Vercel authentication token
   - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Your Vercel project ID
   - `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Your Vercel organization ID (if required)

2. **Repository Configuration**:
   - Branch name matches workflow configuration
   - All required files are present and properly formatted

3. **Dependencies**:
   - All required packages are listed in `package.json`
   - No conflicting dependency versions

## 🎉 Expected Outcome

With these fixes, your deployment should now:
- ✅ Build successfully without errors
- ✅ Deploy automatically to Vercel
- ✅ Maintain all existing functionality
- ✅ Provide clear error messages if issues occur

## 🔄 Future Updates

For future deployments:
1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push origin master
   ```
3. GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy to Vercel

Your Devix Solutions website should now deploy successfully with all functionality intact!
