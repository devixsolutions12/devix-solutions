## How It Works

When a user fills out the contact form:
1. Form data is sent to the `/api/contact` endpoint
2. Server validates the data and creates a WhatsApp link with the message content
3. User is automatically redirected to WhatsApp with a pre-filled message
4. Message includes user's name, email, and their project details
