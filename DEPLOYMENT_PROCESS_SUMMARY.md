## Deployment Timeline

- GitHub Actions will complete the deployment within 5-10 minutes
- No manual intervention is required

## Vercel CLI Deployment Limitation

The Vercel CLI is currently reporting a deployment limit error:
```
Error: Resource is limited - try again in 4 hours (more than 100, code: "api-deployments-free-per-day")
```

This is a temporary limitation of the Vercel free tier. The GitHub Actions deployment will work without this limitation.

## Verification After Deployment

After deployment is complete, you can verify the changes by:

2. Checking that Instagram is visible in the contact section
3. Confirming the Enterprise plan shows ₹34,999
4. Testing the contact form to ensure it still redirects to WhatsApp
