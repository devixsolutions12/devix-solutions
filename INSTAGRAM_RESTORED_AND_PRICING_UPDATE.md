# Instagram Restored and Pricing Update ✅

## Summary of Changes

This update implements the requested changes to restore Instagram in the contact information while maintaining WhatsApp redirection for contact form submissions, and updates the Enterprise plan price.

## Changes Made

### 1. Instagram Restored
- **Added Instagram back** to contact information section
- **Maintained WhatsApp redirection** for contact form submissions (no change to redirection logic)
- **Updated contact methods** to include both WhatsApp and Instagram

### 2. Pricing Updates

### 3. Contact Form Redirection (Unchanged)

- **Instagram is available as a contact method** but does not receive form submissions

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes (Contact Component)
- File: `src/components/Contact.tsx`

- Added Instagram back to contactMethods array with proper styling
- Maintained WhatsApp redirection for form submissions

### Pricing Component Updates
- File: `src/components/Pricing.tsx`

## How It Works

### Contact Form (Unchanged)
When a user fills out the contact form:
1. Form data is sent to the `/api/contact` endpoint
2. Server validates the data and creates a WhatsApp link with the message content
3. User is automatically redirected to WhatsApp with a pre-filled message
4. Message includes user's name, email, and their project details

### Contact Information (Updated)
Users can now reach out through multiple channels:
1. **Phone**: Direct call to your number
2. **Email**: Send an email to your business address
3. **WhatsApp**: Chat directly through WhatsApp (form submissions go here)
4. **Instagram**: Follow and message through Instagram (added back as requested)

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Build completed successfully

## Next Steps

## Benefits

2. **Maintained Efficiency**: Form submissions still go directly to WhatsApp for quick responses
3. **Brand Presence**: Instagram presence restored for social engagement
4. **Competitive Pricing**: Updated Enterprise plan price to be more competitive
