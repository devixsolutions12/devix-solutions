## How It Works

When a user fills out the contact form:
1. Form data is sent to `/api/contact` endpoint
2. Server validates the data
3. Server creates Instagram DM link with the message content
4. Frontend redirects user to Instagram DMs with pre-filled message
5. User can then send the message directly from Instagram

## Next Steps

The website is now live and fully functional. All contact form submissions will be redirected to your Instagram DMs as requested.
