# Deployment Fix Summary ✅

## Issue Identified

The deployment was showing as successful in the build logs, but you received an email saying it failed and the website was returning a 401 Unauthorized error when accessed.

## Root Cause

Based on our knowledge base and investigation, the issue was caused by the Vercel project privacy setting being configured to private. When a Vercel project is set to private, it returns a 401 Unauthorized error even when the code builds and deploys successfully.

## Fix Applied

1. **Updated vercel.json**: Added `"public": true` to the configuration file
2. **Committed and pushed**: The change was committed to GitHub
3. **Automatic deployment**: GitHub Actions automatically triggered a new deployment

## Changes Made

### File: vercel.json
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "public": true,
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

The addition of `"public": true` ensures that the deployed website is accessible to the public without authentication.

## Deployment Status

- ✅ Changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ New deployment automatically triggered via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Deployment should complete within 5-10 minutes

## Monitoring

You can monitor the deployment progress at:
[GitHub Actions - Devix Solutions](https://github.com/devixsolutions12/devix-solutions/actions)

## Verification

Once the deployment completes, you can verify the fix by:
1. Visiting your website URL
2. Confirming that you no longer see a 401 Unauthorized error
3. Checking that all your previous changes (Instagram restoration, pricing updates) are still present

## Website URL

After the deployment completes, your website will be accessible at:
[https://devix-solutions-6ni7iavft-om-anands-projects-f7ff15cb.vercel.app](https://devix-solutions-6ni7iavft-om-anands-projects-f7ff15cb.vercel.app)

## Next Steps

No action is required from you at this time. The deployment will complete automatically, and your website should be accessible without the 401 error once it's finished.
